/**
 * Characterization tests for the URI action handler in main.ts (#571).
 *
 * The URI action handler is what an `obsidian://rss-dashboard` link runs:
 * `dispatchUriAction` and its four helpers. These tests pin what it does
 * today, bugs included, through the protocol handler `onload` registers, so
 * it can move into its own module (ADR 0015, step 5) without these tests
 * changing. They are read-only on refactor PRs; see
 * docs/development/architecture.md.
 *
 * The Add feed modal is replaced by a recorder, so each test sees what the
 * link asked the modal to show, and the notices the user got, in one place.
