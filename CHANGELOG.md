## 2.7.3 - 2026-10-06

### Features

- Sidebar search now says when nothing matched instead of leaving the sidebar blank. A search with no matching feeds or folders shows **0 results** and **No matches found.**, as Obsidian's own search does, and the message clears when the query changes or the search is cleared or closed. [GH Issue #678](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/678)
- Local Dashell candidate: preserves the RSS Dashboard home and feed filters. Article cards save once and open directly in Dashell Reader; repeat opens reuse local files and resume the last supplied language version. Podcasts and videos retain RSS Dashboard's native previews. Reader owns reading appearance, lookup and AI configuration. See [implementation and scope](docs/DASHELL-IMPLEMENTATION.md) and [validation](docs/DASHELL-VERIFICATION-2026-10-04.md).
- Dashell RSS uses the final plugin ID `dashell-rss`. First launch can copy settings, feed shards, article state, learning records and backups from `rss-dashboard` or the previous `dshell-rss` candidate without deleting the source.

### Fixes
- Fixed dashboard article star buttons appearing circular; their backgrounds now have the same rounded rectangle corners as neighboring action icons.
- Fixed saved-note frontmatter keeping a literal `{{summary}}` when the note template has no frontmatter. It now uses the article summary. [GH Issue #674](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/674)
- Associated the visible **Card spacing** label with the dashboard slider so assistive technology announces its name, value, and range. [GH Issue #714](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/714)
- Fixed a touch long-press on a sidebar feed or folder from also opening that row when the finger lifts. [GH Issue #602](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/602)
- Fixed podcast episodes with relative enclosure URLs failing to play by resolving enclosure URLs against the feed URL. [GH Issue #624](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/624) pi
- Fixed Stop during a Discover single-feed add leaving the global feed operation active until the fetch timed out. Pressing Stop now ends the add, so the sidebar clears promptly and another feed operation can start. [GH Issue #482](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/482)
- Gave the dashboard menu's refresh button the accessible name **Refresh feeds**, including in popout windows. [GH Issue #713](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/713)
- Fixed saved feeds with missing folders staying orphaned after startup. Their folders are now repaired on the first load, as they already were after a settings reload. [GH Issue #452](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/452)
- Fixed Reader article titles inheriting low-contrast H1 colors from themes. [GH Issue #707](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/707)

- Made the dashboard article header menu and its custom selectors keyboard-operable, prevented dashboard shortcuts from intercepting Enter on controls, and made Escape close the open picker before the hamburger menu. [GH Issue #696](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/696)
- Fixed feed refreshes clearing Ctrl/Cmd-selected feed highlights and multi-feed sidebar actions while the article list still showed the selected feeds. [GH Issue #653](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/653)
- Fixed dashboard article stars shrinking to 40px wide in narrow touch layouts. They now keep a rounded 44px by 44px hit target. [GH Issue #689](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/689)
- Corrected sentence case for sidebar toolbar labels and related UI text. [GH Issue #656](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/656)
- Fixed the first-launch **Add your first feed here** hint staying on screen when the sidebar redrew during its first five seconds. It now disappears five seconds after it first appears. [GH Issue #628](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/628)
- Fixed the sidebar's **Sort** button doing nothing from the keyboard. Enter or Space now opens the sort menu below the button, the same as clicking it. [GH Issue #627](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/627)
- Fixed saved article notes corrupting titles, authors, feed names, and other template values that contain `$` sequences. [GH Issue #672](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/672)
- Fixed the Manage Feeds import and export button labels becoming unreadable in Obsidian's light theme. [GH Issue #694](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/694)
- Fixed the dashboard mobile **Filters** button so clicking it again closes the open filter menu. Clicking outside or **Apply** still closes it. [GH Issue #704](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/704)
- Made each Card view article's opener, title, feed source, description, and toolbar actions reachable in keyboard order; Enter on the opener opens that article. [GH Issue #720](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/720)
- Standardized article star controls on the filled yellow starred state and made the outline darken on hover across dashboard and Reader views. The dashboard's circular background remains dashboard-specific. [GH Issue #684](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/684)
- Fixed the user preferences import notice claiming feeds were imported when the file only contained folders or tags. The notice now names the collections the file included. [GH Issue #464](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/464)
- Fixed vertical misalignment among Reader toolbar icons and removed the dashboard-style circle from the Tags action. [GH Issue #680](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/680)
- Fixed the navigation drawer keeping every closed copy of itself, with its full feed list and the previous article list, in memory. On desktop windows narrower than 1200px each folder change leaked about 2,000 elements, which slowed Obsidian down over a long session and could end in an out-of-memory crash. [GH Issue #664](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/664)
- Dashell RSS uses the `dashell-rss` plugin ID and copies existing settings, feed shards, and learning records from `rss-dashboard` or the previous `dshell-rss` candidate on first launch. Existing files stay in place for rollback, and plugin-default storage paths are redirected to the Dashell folder.
- The customized plugin identifies its maintainer as dashell and links to dashell7's GitHub. The About page separates Dashell maintenance from upstream attribution and support.
- Articles saved for Dashell Reader turn body hyperlinks into ordinary text so linked words support hover and click lookup. Original, translated and rewritten versions retain text formatting, images and their source URL; RSS previews keep their links.
- Podcast and video cards use the original RSS preview and media players, without an automatic download or Dashell Player requirement. Media preview location is configurable again; switching from a preparing article to media prevents the late article from taking over.
- Saved Dashell articles and their automatic reading notes use article titles instead of generic `material` filenames. Supplied translations and rewrites retain distinct title-based filenames and version switching.
- Localized the plugin settings tabs in Simplified Chinese, including dynamic control labels and tooltips. Internal tab IDs, saved values, paths, and user-defined tags, highlights, and template names remain unchanged.
- Fixed editing a feed to another subscribed feed's URL creating a duplicate subscription. The URL change is now refused without changing either feed. Existing duplicates can still be edited when their URL stays the same. [GH Issue #554](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/554)
- Fixed the reader removing story text or other media along with a duplicate lead image when both were wrapped in a link or figure. [GH Issue #629](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/629)
- Fixed **Use site icons/favicons for RSS feeds** turning itself back on after a settings reload. Loading unchanged settings no longer saves them on every startup. [GH Issue #564](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/564)
- Fixed importing user preferences with non-list folders or tags discarding your current lists and preventing an OPML auto-backup. [GH Issue #537](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/537)
- Fixed Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) on a feed replacing a folder opened with a plain click instead of adding to it. The article list now shows the folder's articles plus the feed's, the same as when the folder was Ctrl+clicked first. [GH Issue #489](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/489)
- Fixed Shift+click range selection and Ctrl/Cmd+click folder selection in the navigation drawer failing to update the dashboard. [GH Issue #493](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/493)
- Fixed Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) on a feed in the navigation drawer acting as a plain click. It now adds the feed to the selection and keeps the drawer open, the same as Ctrl/Cmd+click on a folder. [GH Issue #546](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/546)
- Fixed Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) on a feed highlighting it while the article list still showed only the feed opened with a plain click. The list now shows both feeds. [GH Issue #547](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/547)
- Fixed articles saved from an open reader after settings reloads, imports, or factory reset using the old save folder and template. The reader now uses current settings and the current article saver. [GH Issue #448](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/448)
- Fixed new podcast feeds being assigned to a separate **Podcast** folder instead of the default **Podcasts** folder. Existing folder preferences are preserved. [GH Issue #461](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/461)
- Fixed the dashboard filter menu so selecting **Tagged** with a specific tag in **Or** mode shows only articles carrying that tag. [GH Issue #463](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/463)
- Fixed Shortcut help showing two close buttons on Obsidian 1.13 and restored native close-button positioning in the mobile Navigation and Discover filters modals. [GH Issue #500](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/500)
- Fixed refreshes and background imports continuing to save stale settings after the plugin unloads. Unload now aborts active feed work, clears its timers, and prevents image-cache workers from starting more work or writing pending results. Feeds from an OPML import interrupted by the unload now fetch their articles on the next load instead of staying empty. [GH Issue #444](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/444)
- Fixed JSON Feed subscriptions failing to refresh because valid JSON Feed responses were rejected by XML-only validation. JSON Feed version documents now pass validation, and feed requests advertise `application/feed+json`. [GH Issue #462](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/462)
- Fixed a settings load failure allowing a later setting or feed change to overwrite `data.json` with defaults. Failed loads now use isolated fallback settings, keep services aligned with them, block saves until a later load succeeds, and show the unavailable-metadata warning only once per failure incident. [GH Issue #447](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/447)
- Fixed the **← Discover** button in Kagi Small Web being skipped during keyboard navigation. It now uses a native button that supports Tab focus and Enter/Space activation. [GH Issue #503](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/503)
- Fixed moving the metadata `data.json` out of a hidden vault folder, such as `.rss-meta`, never offering to delete the previous copy and leaving it on disk. **Delete previous metadata copy?** now appears for a previous copy in a hidden folder too, and **Delete previous copy** moves it to the trash. With Shard storage v2, it also removes the previous `user-state.json` after article state has moved to the new metadata folder. Outside v2, an orphaned state file remains as a backup. The plugin folder's own `data.json`, which points to the new location after a move, is never offered for deletion. [GH Issue #410](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/410)
- Fixed podcast playback progress being replaced by an older saved resume point when Obsidian starts. Existing episode progress is preserved, and the obsolete `rss-podcast-progress` local-storage entry is cleared after it is checked. [GH Issue #468](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/468)
- Fixed YouTube handle URLs such as `https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship` in **Add feed** being reported as Mastodon profiles. The preview status read "Mastodon > RSS auto-discovery" and the feed defaulted to the Mastodon folder. It is now detected as YouTube and defaults to the YouTube folder, while real Mastodon profiles are unchanged. [GH Issue #548](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/548)
- Fixed Portable data bundle, Feed bundle, and Settings bundle imports, shard migrations, and shard repairs writing metadata to Obsidian's plugin folder instead of the configured vault `data.json` location. These operations now persist where the plugin will read metadata after restart. [GH Issue #474](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/474)
- Fixed the article list header saying **1 feeds** when exactly one feed is selected. It now says **1 feed**, alone and combined with tags. [GH Issue #582](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/582)
- Fixed the article list header showing an unthemed browser tooltip instead of Obsidian's when a filter is active. The first render set the tooltip with a `title` attribute, so the browser drew it. After a filter change both tooltips appeared at once, with the browser's one stale. It now uses Obsidian's tooltip only. [GH Issue #587](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/587)
- Fixed an OPML import or Discover **Add all** started while another feed operation, such as **Refresh all feeds**, was running saving the feeds but never fetching their articles, while still reporting success. The import is now refused before anything is saved, and only the "A feed operation is already in progress" notice is shown. [GH Issue #451](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/451)
- Fixed moving a multi-selection of folders or feeds, by dragging it or with **Move selection to folder**, leaving the article list on the moved selection. The sidebar cleared its selection, but the article list kept its old heading and articles, and after the next redraw it showed the old folder names with no feeds and no articles. The dashboard now clears its selection too, from the sidebar and from the navigation drawer, and shows **All articles**; a sidebar tag filter that was on stays on. [GH Issue #615](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/615) [GH Issue #659](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/659)
- Fixed moving several folders at once saying "Skipped moving folder into itself or its subfolder." for any folder it couldn't move. A folder refused for another reason now shows that reason, such as "A folder named "Tech" already exists at the destination level.", once for each distinct reason. A subfolder moved together with its parent no longer shows a skip notice. [GH Issue #610](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/610)
- Fixed the dashboard staying on a folder's old path after the folder was moved by dropping it on another folder's feed list or with **Move selection to folder**. The article list kept the old name and, after the next redraw, showed no articles. It now follows the folder to its new location, as dragging a folder onto a folder name already did. [GH Issue #611](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/611)
- Fixed the **Edit tag**, **Add new tag**, **Save article**, **Save with template**, and **Overwrite all feeds** dialogs not closing with Escape and letting clicks reach the app behind them, so repeated clicks could open several copies. They now close with Escape without saving and block the app behind them. [GH Issue #355](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/355)

### Developer

- The lint rule against a `title` attribute now also catches one inside a conditional or logical `attr` value, without flagging an unrelated nested object, and has a test of its own. [GH Issue #587](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/587), [GH Issue #591](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/591)

## 2.7.1 - October 3, 2026

For a user-facing overview, see the [RSS Dashboard 2.7.1 release notes](docs/releases/2.7.1.md).

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed the Manage Feeds import and export button labels becoming unreadable in Obsidian's light theme. [GH Issue #694](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/694)

### Development and compliance

- `npm run build` now completes in a source copy that has no `.git` folder, as in the community directory scanner's clean build. `check:commit-message`, `check:pre-release`, and `check:doc-links` print a notice and skip when there is no git checkout, and stay enforced in the Git hooks and CI.

### Known issues

- With the metadata `data.json` in a vault folder, a Portable data bundle, Feed bundle, or Settings bundle import can be lost if Obsidian closes before anything else is saved. Applying a vault folder under **Settings → Storage → Metadata data.json location** now shows a notice about this: after importing, change a setting or mark an article as read before closing Obsidian. The default location in the plugin folder isn't affected. [GH Issue #474](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/474)
- A failed settings load can let a later change overwrite your saved settings with defaults. Fixed for the next release. [GH Issue #447](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/447)
- Podcast playback progress can be replaced by an older resume point when Obsidian starts. Fixed for the next release. [GH Issue #468](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/468)

## 2.7.0 - October 2, 2026

For a user-facing overview, see the [RSS Dashboard 2.7.0 release notes](docs/releases/2.7.0.md).

### Features

#### Starred article import

- Added **Import starred articles**, which reads a Google Reader-compatible `starred.json` export (confirmed with Inoreader and FreshRSS) from the command palette, the Feed Manager, or **Settings → Import/Export**. The preview groups articles by source feed with per-article and per-feed selection, and imported articles keep their starred state and the export's read state. Articles for feeds you already follow go straight into those feeds; feeds you don't follow are marked with a trailing `*` in the preview and created in one shared **New-feed folder** (default **Starred imports**). See the [Import Starred Articles Guide](docs/user/starred-import-guide.md), the [compatibility notes](docs/user/starred-import-compatibility.md), and [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-generalize-starred-import-to-google-reader-compatible-naming.md). [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234) [GH Issue #330](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/330) [GH Issue #337](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/337)
- The import's **Options** panel has two toggles. **New-feed metadata refresh** (off by default) runs one background fetch for each newly created feed's title, icon, and current items; while it is off, a new feed uses the export's own title and site URL until its next normal refresh. **Import labels as tags** (on by default) turns exported `label/…` categories into tags, reusing a matching palette tag's color (case-insensitive) or adding the label to the palette; state categories such as `starred`, `read`, and `reading-list` never become tags. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- Before importing, a **New tags (N)** section lists every tag the import will add to the palette and updates live as you change the selection or the options. Each preview row carries a tag chip that opens the standard tag editor, so you can add, remove, or create tags for an article before it is imported; renaming or recoloring a tag there updates every preview row that carries it. The New tags section shows each tag as a colored chip you can click to edit, with buttons beside its heading to give every new tag one color, random colors, or the default color. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- Export entries the importer cannot use, such as those missing a source feed or any article link, are listed in an **Unable to import (N)** section with a specific reason instead of being silently dropped. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- Re-running an import against the same or an updated export no longer creates duplicates. Articles already imported are matched by guid and link and updated in place, with new labels merged into their tags and `starred` re-confirmed. Read, saved, and other local changes are left untouched. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- Imported articles start with the export's summary only. Opening one in the reader shows a banner naming the import date, with a **Fetch now** action beside **Open in Browser**; full content is fetched only when you ask, and a failed fetch is remembered so the banner can say so next time. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- The import modal shows step-by-step instructions for getting `starred.json` from an Inoreader account archive, with a direct link to Inoreader's export settings. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)

#### Storage and data

- Legacy JSON and Shard storage v1 are formally deprecated. The storage prompt names 3.0 as the release that makes those modes read-only and lists what stops working: feed refresh, and recording read state, stars, tags, and saved articles. The permanent **Never show again** dismissal is replaced by **Skip this version**, which defers the prompt to the next minor release and is withdrawn after three deferrals; **Remind me later** still defers it to the next load. Anyone who previously chose **Never show again** sees the prompt once more. The prompt now appears when the RSS Dashboard view opens rather than at Obsidian startup. See [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-deprecate-legacy-json-and-shard-storage-v1.md).
- The status line in **Settings → Storage** now shows where the `data.json` metadata is actually written, alongside the shard folder, so it is clear where your data lives after switching storage modes. It also reports a `user-state.json` left behind by an earlier Shard storage v2 setup and names its path. That file is deliberately not deleted, because after a revert it is the only standalone copy of read, starred, tagged, and saved state; remove it by hand once you no longer need it. [GH Issue #284](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/284)
- Shard storage v2 now clears stored read, starred, and tag state for articles that have been missing from their feed for 90 days, and only after that feed's shard has loaded and validated in the current session, so state for missing, corrupt, or not-yet-synced shards is kept. `user-state.json` is upgraded to version 3, and older state keyed by bare guid ages out safely. [GH Issue #315](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/315)
- The sidebar now warns about feeds whose shard file is missing or corrupted, with hover guidance to repair or rebuild storage and refetch the feed. When no shard has arrived at all and the storage folder is hidden (such as the default `.rss-dashboard-data/feeds`, which Obsidian Sync and most sync tools skip), the dashboard shows one alert explaining this instead, telling you not to repair on that device and to move the storage and metadata folders to visible ones on the device where your articles appear. The alert clears as soon as a refresh brings articles to that device. [GH Issue #379](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/379)
- With Shard storage v2, when the storage folder is visible but the metadata folder is hidden, **Settings → Storage** warns under **Metadata data.json location** that read, starred, and tag state (`user-state.json`) stays in the hidden folder and won't sync. The same notice appears after you apply a storage folder change or migrate to Shard storage v2. [GH Issue #376](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/376)
- Changing the storage folder on a device where some feeds have not loaded their articles now asks for confirmation first, explaining that the setting reaches every synced device and should be changed where your articles appear. See [ADR 0012](docs/adr/0012-guard-storage-folder-changes-instead-of-detecting-twin-folders.md).
- **Repair/rebuild storage** now previews what it will do before changing anything: how many shard files it will rewrite, which feeds it will skip, and any shard on disk that would be replaced with fewer articles than it currently holds. You can cancel from the preview.
- Added **Feed bundle** (feeds, folders, tags, articles, and article state) and **Settings bundle** (app preferences only) as separate JSON export and import scopes, alongside the existing Portable data bundle and OPML export, on both the Storage and Import/Export settings tabs. [GH Issue #254](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/254)
- The exported user preferences file is renamed from `usersettings.json` to `rss-dashboard-user-preferences.json`, with its buttons renamed **Import user preferences** and **Export user preferences**; auto-backup still recognizes an existing `usersettings.json`. The Portable, Feed, and Settings bundle sections gained copy-to-clipboard buttons, and each bundle section names its default export filename. [GH Issue #254](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/254)
- Imports that replace your feeds or overwrite your preferences now ask first. After the file is read and validated, and before anything is written, **Replace your feeds?** compares the feeds, articles, starred articles, folders, and tags you have now with what the file brings, and **Overwrite your preferences?** says how many preferences will change and lists the retention and auto-backup ones by name. Either dialog names any change to the storage location, notes feeds that haven't loaded their articles on this device, and offers **Export backup first**, which exports a full Portable data bundle and keeps the dialog open. **Cancel** is focused and changes nothing. This covers the Portable data bundle, Feed bundle, Settings bundle, and user preferences imports. [GH Issue #377](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/377) [GH Issue #390](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/390)
- New installations keep their feed articles and read, starred, and tag state inside the plugin folder (`.obsidian/plugins/rss-dashboard/data/`), so uninstalling the plugin removes them, and **Settings → Storage** shows that folder under **Metadata data.json location**. Existing installations and any storage folder you chose yourself are left where they are, with nothing moved. [GH Issue #319](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/319)

#### Data retention and dates

- Added protection toggles for starred, saved, tagged, and unread articles under **Data Retention** in General settings. Protections apply to automatic expiration and max-item trimming. When you reduce protections or shorten retention, you can prune now, defer pruning to the next refresh, or cancel. Existing users keep starred and saved protection on. [GH Issue #213](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/213)
- Added **Use first-seen date for undated items** in General settings, off by default. When on, articles with no publish date sort, group, and survive auto-delete by a stable date recorded when the plugin first saw them, and that date is displayed as `First seen: <date>` in the reader and with a trailing `*` on dashboard date badges. When off, undated articles sort to the bottom, show "Unknown date", and are removed once auto-delete runs. [GH Issue #283](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/283)

#### Reader and media

- Tap or click an image in the reader to open it in a full-resolution lightbox with progressive loading, 1:1 zoom, panning, and swipe-to-dismiss on mobile. The lightbox loads the original image rather than a cached or downscaled thumbnail. [GH Issue #202](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/202)
- The podcast player's playlist browser is replaced by a bounded episode list with **Load more**, a way back to the current episode, and compact sorting. On mobile, the speed, volume, and sleep-timer controls sit in one centered row, and the sleep control shows its countdown inline. [GH Issue #207](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/207)
- Added a **What's New** popup that shows a short, hand-written summary of the release once after an update (a fresh install never shows it), with screenshots that open in the reader's full-screen viewer. **Settings → About → What's new in vX.Y.Z?** reopens it. [GH Issue #288](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/288) [GH Issue #314](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/314) [GH Issue #402](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/402)
- **Settings → About** now shows the exact build under the version, such as `Version 2.7.0 · build 96cd0b7 · 2026-09-24 18:03 UTC`, with a copy button for bug reports. The short commit identifies the source the build came from, and `+dirty` marks a build made from uncommitted changes, so builds can be compared across devices. [GH Issue #373](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/373)

#### Dashboard, sidebar, and feed management

- Added **Date > Feed** and **Folder > Feed** grouping options. **Date** and **Folder** now show a flat list of cards within each group, while the **> Feed** variants nest collapsible per-feed sections under each group. [GH Issue #195](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/195)
- Added **Move selection to folder** to the sidebar's multi-selection context menu, so selected feeds and folders can be moved to a folder or the root without dragging.
- The sidebar's 'Manage Feeds' buttons are split into a primary row (Add new feed, Import OPML/XML, Export OPML, Import starred articles) and a separate destructive row, which adds **Delete feeds + folders** to clear the whole sidebar behind the same confirmation as **Delete all feeds**. The buttons now stack and size to their content, and the Feed Manager closes when a starred import started from it completes. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- **Import OPML** is renamed **Import OPML/XML** everywhere it appears, because the importer already accepts `.xml` files such as the `subscriptions.xml` in an Inoreader archive. [GH Issue #244](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/244)
- The Edit feed modal has a red **Delete** button, with actions stacking vertically on mobile, and the **Save** button in the Add feed and Edit feed modals now uses the same purple as the **Load** button.
- Added **AI Weekly** (`https://aiweekly.co/feed`), a free curated AI newsletter, to the Discover catalog under Technology → Artificial Intelligence. [GH Issue #206](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/206)
- New tags now start with the color `#8a5cf5` wherever they are created: the sidebar, **Settings → Tags**, the tag picker's inline add row, and labels brought in by a starred import. Existing tags keep their colors.

#### Saving articles

- Added the `{{saveDate}}` (`YYYY-MM-DD`), `{{saveTime12}}` (`hh:mm A`), and `{{saveTime24}}` (`HH:mm`) template variables, which insert the local date and time of the save.
- Added a `{{firstSeen}}` template variable for the body and frontmatter templates. It inserts the date the article was first seen in the dashboard, falling back to the publish date and then the save date, and works whether or not **Use first-seen date for undated items** is on.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
#### Storage and data

- Fixed Shard storage v2 silently losing read, starred, tagged, saved, and playback state. `user-state.json` was rebuilt from memory on every save, so a feed that failed to load, had not synced to this device yet, or had items pruned by retention lost that state, and sync spread the loss to other devices. State is now merged with what is on disk and keyed by feed and guid, so feeds sharing a guid no longer overwrite each other, and marking an article unread now survives sync. A `user-state.json` that cannot be read is never overwritten; a notice and a red alert on the dashboard status strip stay until it is readable again. [GH Issue #278](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/278)
- Fixed Shard storage v2 erasing another device's read, starred, tagged, saved, and playback state. Each save removed state for every feed missing from the saving device's own feed list, so a device whose feed list had not synced yet deleted state for feeds added elsewhere. A feed's state is now removed at once only when you delete or unsubscribe from that feed on this device; state for a feed this device doesn't list is kept, and cleared only after 90 days without the feed appearing. Importing a Portable data bundle, a Feed bundle, a legacy `data.json`, or a preferences file that includes feeds likewise keeps state for feeds it leaves out, so it returns if a later import brings those feeds back. Update every device that shares a vault: an older version on any of them still removes that state. [GH Issue #374](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/374)
- Fixed deleting a feed or folder leaving its shard file on disk when the storage folder is hidden, such as the default `.rss-dashboard-data/feeds`, and changing the storage folder leaving old shards behind. Deleting a folder now also removes feeds in its nested subfolders. Shards orphaned by earlier deletions are not cleaned up. [GH Issue #316](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/316)
- Fixed deleted or corrupted feed shards making a feed permanently unfetchable. Each settings save now checks that shard files exist and contain the expected feed, and rebuilds them when this device has articles to rebuild them from. A save or repair never writes an empty shard for a feed whose shard has not loaded, never creates an empty `user-state.json`, and never overwrites a valid shard that another device changed through sync, so a device that starts before sync finishes can no longer replace your feeds on other devices with empty copies.
- Fixed changing the storage folder leaving the old folder behind, empty, and reverting to Legacy JSON leaving empty parent folders behind. An emptied folder, and any parent folder left empty, is now removed; a visible folder goes to your trash according to your deletion setting. A folder that still holds anything else, such as `user-state.json` or your own files, is kept.
- Fixed **Refresh details** opening on mobile as a thin, unreadable strip beside the sidebar. On mobile it now opens as a modal that stays open until dismissed, and on desktop the popup moves below the row when there is no room beside it.
- Fixed reverting from shard storage to Legacy JSON appearing to succeed and then loading an empty dashboard on the next launch, which also stopped the storage deprecation prompt from appearing after a revert.
- Fixed plugin settings being reset to defaults and saved over your configuration when metadata is stored in a vault folder and its `data.json` cannot be read. Nothing is written back in that case, and a notice reports the problem.
- Fixed configured backups not creating a portable data bundle when the data backup toggle was on, including in Shard storage v2. Backups now write one recovery snapshot after the first settings save in a session, and a final snapshot on unload only if later changes made it stale. [GH Issue #320](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/320)
- Fixed the recovery snapshot being skipped, with a `Backup after save failed` console error, when loading settings at startup saved an upgraded or cleaned-up configuration. That startup save is now backed up.
- The image cache folder is no longer created while **Allow image caching** is off, and it now lives inside the plugin's actual install folder. Turning the setting off removes the cache folder. A stray `plugins/rss-dashboard/image-cache` folder from an earlier build is not migrated and can be deleted by hand.
- Fixed automatic retention keeping unread articles older than a feed's auto-delete cutoff indefinitely when the source feed still lists them. They are now deleted by default; turn on the unread protection under **Data Retention** to keep them. [GH Issue #213](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/213)
- Fixed cancelling a background import leaving its unfetched feeds permanently excluded from global refresh. [GH Issue #249](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/249)
- Fixed settings that sync in from another device being ignored by parts of the plugin until Obsidian restarted. After the reload, auto-backups could write the pre-sync feed list to `feeds.opml.backup`, new folders were added to the old folder list and lost, and feeds that arrived with a folder this device lacked did not get that folder created.
- Fixed **Import user preferences** in **Settings → Import/Export** showing **Import successful** after an invalid file had already been rejected. It now shows only the error. [GH Issue #377](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/377)
- Fixed moving the metadata `data.json` out of a hidden vault folder, such as `.rss-meta`, never offering to delete the previous copy and leaving it on disk. **Delete previous metadata copy?** now appears for a previous copy in a hidden folder too, and **Delete previous copy** moves it to the trash. The plugin folder's own `data.json`, which points to the new location after a move, is never offered for deletion. [GH Issue #410](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/410)
- Fixed **Import user preferences** deleting every feed when the file lists folders or tags but no feeds. A file without a feed list now keeps your current feeds, as it already kept your folders and tags. [GH Issue #386](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/386)

#### Refresh

- Fixed automatic refresh for feeds on the global interval running as staggered per-feed batches that caused repeated notifications, list flashes, lag, and dashboard scroll resets. Eligible feeds now refresh in one batch, and stopping an automatic batch cancels its work promptly and defers the retry to the next interval. [GH Issue #208](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/208)
- Fixed global refresh leaving a finished feed's sidebar hourglass visible until every other feed finished. Feed rows now update within 250 ms of each fetch settling. [GH Issue #324](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/324)
- Fixed the global-refresh **Stop** button not appearing on mobile and tablet.

#### Feed parsing and dates

- Fixed articles with no publish date showing "Invalid Date" in the reader header, dashboard date badges, video player, and podcast episode list. They now show the first-seen date when **Use first-seen date for undated items** is on, and "Unknown date" otherwise; the podcast episode list omits the date row instead.
- Fixed the RSS2JSON proxy fallback inventing a publish date of "now" for undated items, which pinned them to the top of the list and kept them from ever aging out. [GH Issue #281](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/281)
- Fixed the RSS2JSON proxy fallback producing malformed XML when a feed's title or description contained `&` or `<`, which also let a crafted value inject extra elements into the rebuilt feed. All values are now escaped. [GH Issue #279](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/279)
- Fixed the RSS2JSON proxy fallback giving every link-less item the same empty guid, so those items overwrote each other's read, starred, and tag state. [GH Issue #285](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/285)
- Fixed the RSS2JSON proxy fallback declaring English as the language of feeds that declare none. [GH Issue #276](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/276)
- Fixed publish dates using old US timezone abbreviations such as `CST`, `PST`, or `EST` sometimes parsing as invalid.
- **Open in browser** and **Copy article URL** are now hidden from the article context menu for articles with no link, instead of opening a blank tab or copying an empty string.
- Removed the Nitter integration and automatic X/Twitter-to-Nitter feed conversion, following the [shutdown of Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) on August 24, 2026. Adding an `x.com`, `twitter.com`, or `nitter.*` URL now explains this and suggests a third-party RSS bridge such as RSSHub.

#### Reader

- The reader no longer shows a **Feed description** box reading "No feed description available." when an article's feed supplies no usable description; the article body now follows the header directly. [GH Issue #247](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/247)
- Fixed code blocks in the reader running off the right edge as one clipped line with no background. Code blocks now render as a shaded monospace box that wraps within the reader width, and inline code is shaded. Reddit code blocks still read as run-on text because Reddit's RSS strips their line breaks. [GH Issue #363](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/363) [GH Issue #365](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/365)
- Fixed full articles from sites that block direct requests with HTTP 401 or 403 never being retried through the configured CORS proxy. Obsidian reports those responses as errors, so the reader gave up and showed the feed excerpt without trying the proxy. It now retries through the proxy first. [GH Issue #408](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/408)
- Fixed an article not appearing in an ungrouped dashboard list when a change from the reader, such as starring it while the dashboard is filtered to Starred, made it match the current filters. The update stopped with an error, leaving the list and the status bar count stale until the next refresh. [GH Issue #409](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/409)
- Fixed preview images no longer being cached after a cached image file was deleted outside the plugin, for example by you or a sync tool, until Obsidian was restarted. Lowering the image cache limit could also fail without saving, and **Clear image cache** said the deleted image could not be removed and kept counting it in the cache size. A cached image file that is already gone now counts as removed. [GH Issue #372](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/372)

#### Starring, tags, and saving

- Fixed an article's read toggle needing two clicks to mark it unread after **Mark page read** marked it read; the first click now marks it unread.
- Starring an article no longer adds a "Favorite" tag, and unstarring no longer removes one; starring and tagging are now independent. New installs no longer include "Favorite" in the default tag palette, and existing "Favorite" tags are left untouched. See [ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-decouple-starred-state-from-tags.md). [GH Issue #331](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/331)
- Fixed renaming or recoloring a tag not reaching a card whose tags you had already changed in the same session. The card kept the old tag, the tag picker showed none of its tags as checked, and the next tag you checked saved the old tag back alongside the new one.
- Fixed saved-note frontmatter breaking when an article's title, author, feed title, or link contained a `"`, which also let a crafted title inject frontmatter keys. [GH Issue #286](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/286)
- Saved notes no longer get broken frontmatter when an article's title or author contains control or line-separator characters. [GH Issue #356](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/356)
- Fixed turning off **Import labels as tags** in the starred import preview leaving label chips visible on each row, and discarding tags you had added by hand. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- Fixed the OPML and starred import modals keeping a stale error or preview on screen after you pick a different file. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- The Import OPML preview now labels a feed without a folder as `<None>` instead of `Uncategorized`, which implied a folder of that name would be created. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- The **How to get starred.json from Inoreader** instructions in the Import starred articles modal now hide once a file loads into the preview, leaving the **Import file…** row in place so you can still switch files; they reappear if a replacement file fails to load. [PR #353](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/pull/353)
- Choosing a new file with **Import file…** in the Import starred articles or Import OPML/XML modal now resets the preview's expanded/collapsed groups instead of carrying over the previous file's state. [PR #353](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/pull/353)
- Fixed saving an article, exporting the keyboard shortcuts, and saving from the web viewer failing with "Failed to create folder" or "Could not create folder" when the save folder differs from an existing folder only in case, such as `rss articles` and `RSS Articles`, on Windows and macOS. They now save into the existing folder. [GH Issue #411](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/411)

#### Discover, sidebar, and folders

- Fixed the Discover **Add to...** and **Add all feeds** folder picker dead-ending with "No folders found" in a vault with no folders. The picker now always offers **Root (no folder)** and **Add new folder**, and creating a folder there assigns the feed to it in one step. The picker is disabled while the new-folder dialog is open and no longer closes when that dialog's OK or Cancel is clicked. [GH Issue #243](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/243)
- Fixed feeds added to **Root (no folder)**, including YouTube and podcast feeds and feeds added with **Add all feeds**, landing in "Videos", "Podcast", or "Uncategorized" instead. [GH Issue #243](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/243)
- Fixed the **Add new folder...** entry in the Add feed and Edit feed folder picker doing nothing; it now reads `Add "<name>"` and creates the folder you typed. [GH Issue #234](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/234)
- Fixed Feed view grouping so **Grouping: Disabled** shows a flat list and **Grouping: Feed** shows one collapsible header per feed. [GH Issue #195](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/195)
- Fixed Discover pagination stacking vertically; it now matches the Dashboard's horizontal layout.
- Fixed dragging several selected sidebar feeds moving only one; all selected feeds now move together and keep their order.
- Fixed right-clicking a feed selected through its parent folder opening the single-feed menu, where **Delete feed** removed only that feed.
- Fixed the **Delete selection** confirmation counting only individually selected feeds. It now tallies everything the delete removes in plain language, such as "Delete 7 folders (and 2 subfolders) containing 47 feeds, plus 11 other feeds?", counting each feed and nested folder once.
- Fixed the dashboard header still listing deleted folders and feeds, such as `Folders: News, Tech (Feeds: 12)`, after deleting a sidebar selection. Deleted folders and feeds now leave the selection immediately.
- Fixed shift-click range selection over feeds whose folder no longer exists turning into a selection of that missing folder.
- Fixed collapsing or expanding the sidebar, and **Collapse/Expand all folders**, rebuilding the whole dashboard instead of only the sidebar.
- Fixed deleting a feed or folder from the sidebar on mobile leaving it listed until Obsidian restarted; it now disappears immediately. [GH Issue #378](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/378)
- Fixed sidebar keyboard shortcuts (such as `Shift+D` to delete) still running while a dialog was open, which could stack a second delete confirmation under the first so a quick **OK** deleted a feed you were no longer looking at. Dashboard shortcuts now pause while any dialog is open, and only one sidebar delete confirmation shows at a time.
- Fixed sidebar keyboard navigation (`Shift+J`/`Shift+L`) stepping onto hidden feeds inside collapsed folders.
- Fixed a sidebar **Refresh details** popup staying on screen after you clicked its row and moved to another row, which left two popups showing. Only one popup shows at a time now, including the one opened from the context menu, and moving to another row replaces it. A row focused from the keyboard still keeps its popup open. [PR #394](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/pull/394)
- Fixed the sidebar **Refresh details** popup, on hover and from the context menu, being hidden behind the sidebar drawer when the dashboard is narrow enough to open the sidebar as a drawer, such as in a narrow popout window.
- Fixed the sidebar after moving the dashboard to a popout window: hovering a feed showed its **Refresh details** popup in the main window instead of the popout, and widening a narrow popout left the sidebar drawer floating open over the inline sidebar. Both now follow the window that shows the dashboard.
- Fixed Discover's mobile **Add to...** picker opening away from its button. It now keeps its calculated vertical position while using the mobile-width layout.
- Fixed Discover's **Add to...** picker silently attempting to add a feed that had already been added while the picker was open, and overlapping add requests creating duplicate subscriptions. Duplicate URLs are now refused and reported.
- Fixed clearing a **Default folders** setting, such as **Default YouTube folder**, saving the folder as `/`. New feeds of that type were filed under a folder named `/` that doesn't exist, so they showed at the top level while **Move to folder** didn't mark them as in the root, and the setting showed `/` instead of the default. A cleared field now files new feeds in the root again. [GH Issue #372](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/372)

#### Obsidian compatibility and settings

- The minimum supported Obsidian version is now 1.8.7, and release compatibility mappings are corrected so unsupported Obsidian versions are not offered an unverified build. [GH Issue #228](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/228)
- Settings controls now adapt to the running Obsidian version: destructive settings, modal, and feed-management confirmations use version-aware controls with unchanged actions, and sliders on older supported versions show their formatted value while dragging, using the keyboard, or editing a paired input. [GH Issue #229](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/229) [GH Issue #230](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/230) [GH Issue #231](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/231)
- Fixed the **Storage mode** description in Settings → Storage showing `[object DocumentFragment]`, notably in popped-out windows. [GH Issue #248](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/248)
- Fixed buttons and badges across the dashboard, reader, podcast player, sidebar, and import modals showing two tooltips on hover, Obsidian's and the browser's. Every tooltip in the plugin now uses Obsidian's own themed tooltip.
- Fixed dashboard keyboard shortcuts doing nothing after **Move to new window**. Shortcuts now follow the dashboard into a popped-out window and back, keys typed into a text field in the popped-out window stay in that field, and a dialog open in the popped-out window pauses them there.
- Fixed **What's New** appearing on the second launch after a fresh install, as if the new user had just upgraded. A fresh install now records its version on first launch, so the popup shows only after a real update. [GH Issue #402](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/402)
- Fixed the **Add feed** and **Auto tag feeds in folder** modals keeping Obsidian's built-in close button in the phone and tablet layout. Obsidian 1.13 renamed that button, so the plugin no longer found it to remove it. [GH Issue #372](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/372)

### Development and compliance

- Sped up the contributor Git hooks: pre-commit lints only staged files and runs only their related tests, and the full build and unit suite run on pre-push. [GH Issue #371](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/371)
- Article HTML sanitization now applies the same URL check used for links to every URL-bearing attribute.
- ESLint now rejects `title` attributes used as tooltips, since Obsidian draws its own tooltip from `aria-label`; use `setTooltip()` from `obsidian` instead.
- Hardened the release workflow by separating read-only build validation from privileged publishing and provenance, pinning workflow Actions to reviewed commits, and attesting `manifest.json` alongside the bundle. The test workflow now runs on pushes to `master` and `dev`.
- Aligned tooling with the Obsidian sample-plugin baseline: TypeScript targets ES2021, Node maintenance scripts are linted under a scoped policy, and repeat version bumps keep existing `versions.json` mappings. [GH Issue #240](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/240)
- Adopted the sample plugin's `noImplicitReturns` compiler check, and restored the recommended `no-empty` lint rule so empty `catch` blocks are no longer allowed; the two in the sidebar's drag-and-drop handling now return an explicit empty result.
- CI now verifies the Obsidian support floor and that the current release's `versions.json` mapping matches `manifest.json`.
- Limited the legacy settings-renderer deprecation allowance to the code that needs it while Obsidian 1.8.7 through 1.12.x are supported. [GH Issue #232](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/232)
- Resolved post-2.6.0 community plugin scorecard findings: replaced `document.createElement` with Obsidian DOM helpers, replaced the unknown `mjx-container` CSS type selector with class and attribute selectors, and removed an unnecessary type assertion in `settings-loader.ts`.
- Added `docs/development/test-feeds/`, a reference list of real-world feeds used for manual QA; it surfaced the undated-item and timezone date bugs fixed above.
- HTML entities in feed text, feed previews, and podcast title lookups are now decoded in one pass by a shared decoder. Text that was escaped twice keeps one level of escaping, and feed previews show named entities such as `&eacute;` as letters.
- Rich article rendering now keeps a fixed set of HTML tags; other tags are unwrapped and their text is kept.
- Feed, image, and podcast host checks now compare the URL's hostname instead of searching the whole URL.
- Long feed text and Cloudinary image URLs are now matched with simpler patterns that run in linear time.
- Patched development dependencies for new npm audit advisories (`brace-expansion`, `undici`, `fast-uri`) and removed the unused `moment` development dependency. The plugin still uses Obsidian's built-in `moment`.

### Known issues

- With the metadata `data.json` in a vault folder, a Portable data bundle, Feed bundle, or Settings bundle import can be lost if Obsidian closes before anything else is saved. Applying a vault folder under **Settings → Storage → Metadata data.json location** now shows a notice about this: after importing, change a setting or mark an article as read before closing Obsidian. The default location in the plugin folder isn't affected. [GH Issue #474](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/474)
- A failed settings load can let a later change overwrite your saved settings with defaults. Fixed for the next release. [GH Issue #447](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/447)
- Podcast playback progress can be replaced by an older resume point when Obsidian starts. Fixed for the next release. [GH Issue #468](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/468)

## 2.6.0 - August 24, 2026

### Features

- Added a paged podcast playlist that renders a five-episode window around the active episode, with order-relative browsing controls, a return-to-current action for large feeds, and placeholder-first artwork loading that avoids empty or broken-image boxes. This should alleviate performance issues for feeds with many episodes. [GH Issue #183](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/183)
- Added opt-in local caching for Dashboard Card and Feed preview images, with a 1 MiB per-image limit, a synchronized 1–1024 MiB slider/input or unlimited aggregate cap, cache management controls, remote-image fallback, cache warming after feed additions and OPML/background imports, protection against refreshes overwriting Discover feeds that are still hydrating, and automatic cache cleanup when all feeds are deleted. [GH Issue #177](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/177)
- Added a Stop button on the All feeds sidebar row during global refreshes, allowing users to cancel an in-progress refresh, including when only one eligible feed remains. Cancelled feeds do not advance their refresh timestamps, and in-progress fetches are aborted via an AbortSignal. Failed-feed retries and folder/selected/tag/due refreshes remain non-cancellable. [GH Issue #173](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/173)
- Added Shift+click and an All feeds context-menu action to retry failed, non-excluded feeds without advancing the global refresh timestamp. [GH Issue #168](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/168)
- Added static refresh-status timestamps and accessible refresh details for all feeds, folders, and feeds. [GH Issue #167](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/167)
- New installations now default global feed auto-refresh to Off.
- Added automatic and per-feed Windows-1251 decoding for RSS/Atom feeds, including preview and refresh support. New dropdown available in the add/edit feed window > Feed options > Feed Encoding [GH Issue #155](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/155)
- Added a saved-template selector when saving articles to a custom folder, including immediate selection of newly created templates and viewable templates via Article Savings tab. [GH Issue #158](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/158)
- Added a new **Settings > Display > Dashboard** option to choose whether pagination controls appear at the top or bottom of the page, with bottom as the default. [GH Issue #161](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/161)
- Added formula-aware selection in Reader views: rendered LaTeX is visibly highlighted and copies as its retained source while preserving surrounding article text.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed dashboard header Mark all read/unread controls so they update and persist the stored articles in the current filtered view. [GH Issue #185](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/185)
- Removed duplicate close controls from mobile Dashboard and Discover sidebars, retaining Obsidian's standard modal header close button.
- Standardized sidebar and mobile navigation scrolling on native Obsidian scrollbars, removing the retired scrollbar-visibility preference and custom scrollbar styling in order to improve Community Plugin compliance score.
- Fixed OPML imports and Discover Add actions so their feed fetching uses the global sidebar spinner and Stop action, cancels active and queued work, preserves completed results, and ignores late results after cancellation. [GH Issue #179](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/179)
- Fixed dashboard Card and Feed preview settings so cover images and summaries can be controlled independently, cover-only cards retain their image on hover, and disabling cover images avoids dashboard preview-image loading. [GH Issue #175](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/175)
- Fixed sidebar icon visibility settings displaying `[object DocumentFragment]` instead of each icon's name.
- Fixed the All feeds refresh-details popup showing alongside Obsidian's delayed native tooltip. [GH Issue #168](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/168)
- Fixed refresh-detail tooltip and ghost-popup regressions, and prevented global-refresh vault saves from reloading empty article shards. [GH Issue #167](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/167)
- Fixed per-feed auto-refresh intervals so Use global, Off, and custom schedules control runtime refresh timing. Failed attempts now wait their configured interval without changing the last successful update time. [GH Issue #166](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/166)
- Fixed low-resolution fallback hero images being stretched across the Reader by preserving their intrinsic width, centering them, and only scaling them down when needed to fit the available space.
- Fixed article saves failing on Windows when long titles produced filenames that exceeded safe path lengths by truncating generated filenames to 100 characters while preserving the full title in the note content. [GH Issue #157](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/157)
- Fix: Math formulas from Math StackExchange feeds now render in Reader content and dashboard title cards through the Markdown renderer lifecycle path, with a small in-memory cache for reopen performance. Full implementation notes are archived in [math rendering investigation](docs/archive/investigations/2026/math-rendering.md). [GH Issue #162](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/162)
- Fixed WordPress LaTeX image formulas being promoted and stretched as article covers. Their embedded TeX now renders as native, theme-aware math in Reader views and is saved with Obsidian-compatible math delimiters, with the original image retained as a render-failure fallback while later article photos remain eligible as covers and heroes.
- Fix: Allow `vault-shards-v2` as a valid storage mode when importing portable data bundles to resolve the "invalid Storagemode value" error.
- Fix: Dashboard and sidebar views now correctly sync their settings reference from the plugin on every refresh, ensuring feed lists and sidebar folders rebuild correctly after cross-device sync delivers new data.
- Fix: Hitting "enter" after inputing a url in the add feed modal now correctly loads the feed instead of advancing to 'Title' input box.

### Development and compliance

- Established a documented idea-to-release plan lifecycle: pre-issue work uses dated draft names, accepted implementation work receives a permanent GitHub issue-number filename, milestones distinguish Required and Stretch release scope, active plans remain in `docs/plans/`, validated implementations move to the indexed `docs/archive/plans/unreleased/` area, and release cuts group them under `v<version>` with metadata, links, and catalog entries updated during handoff.
- Added a repository-local workflow for GitHub issues and feature requests that accepts a supplied issue summary before fetching its URL, preserves exact issue links in changelog entries, applies risk-based Obsidian audit and validation gates, and consolidates public release notes under `docs/releases/` when a release is prepared.
- Strengthened the Obsidian audit baseline by upgrading `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` from 0.1.9 to 0.4.1, enabling its recommended production checks, migrating remaining DOM construction to popout-safe owning-window helpers, and adding shared jsdom coverage for those runtime APIs.
- Enforced a zero-`!important` CSS policy with a repository check and regression tests, and aligned contributor instructions, pull-request guidance, compliance documentation, design guidance, and the plugin scorecard with the stricter policy.

## 2.5.0 - July 11, 2026

### Features

- Added a storage migration pop up on plugin update to encourage users to upgrade to the latest storage mode.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator.

- Fix: shard local storage address not correctly appearing in edit feed window
- Fix: Scrolling not working on mobile Discover sidebar
- Fix: clicking the tag icon on cards a second time will now close the window instead of re-opening it

### Audit remediations

- Fixed: Unexpected browser feature 'multicolumn' is only partially supported by Obsidian 1.4.5
- Fixed: Unexpected browser feature 'css-scrollbar' is only partially supported by Obsidian 1.4.5
- Fixed: This assertion is unnecessary since it does not change the type of the expression.

- Fixed: Use 'activeDocument' instead of 'document' for popout window compatibility.
- Fixed: Removed all 'as any' type declarations
- Fixed: Removed extraneous !important declarations
- Added: ESLint CI blockers for future commits on the above fixes

## 2.4.1 - July 2, 2026

### Features

Added collapsible headers when viewing feeds in "feed" grouping ([GH Issue #149](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/149))

### Plugin Compliance

- Upon submission of 2.4.0, the plugin was flagged with 455 issues found by automated scans. The [2.4.0 audit remediation plan](docs/archive/investigations/2026/2.4.0-audit/2.4.0_audit_remediation_plan.md) was proposed and implemented. The !important warnings all have comments explaining their usage.
- Upon submission of 2.4.0, the plugin was flagged with 455 issues found by automated scans. The [2.4.0 audit remediation plan](docs/archive/investigations/2026/2.4.0-audit/2.4.0_audit_remediation_plan.md) was proposed and implemented. The !important warnings all have comments explaining their usage.
- Additional CI/commit blockers were added to the repo which will disallow future commits that violate eslint rules in order to remain compliant

## 2.4.0 - July 1, 2026

#### Multi-select sidebar folders

- Added ability to control+click and shift+click select multiple folders in the sidebar. This allows you to filter and view only the articles contained within those folders.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed 'custom' input textbox not being hidden when changing between different timeframes in add/edit feed modal ([GH Issue #147](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/147))
- Fixed feeds not being refreshed after deleting all feeds via feed manager modal
- Fixed a bug where a single slow or unresponsive feed fetch could block the rest of the feeds from refreshing or completing an OPML import

## 2.4.0-beta.3 - June 17, 2026

### Features

#### Auto-tag via Folder

- You may now apply multiple auto-tags to articles based upon the sidebar folder they are stored in. This feature is available in the sidebar via right click -> Auto-tag feeds in folder.. You may also target subfolders and may choose to apply tags to all current articles or only future articles.
- 'Sync folder auto-tags' option adds newly selected folder tags where missing, and remove tag names you deselected from this folder's rule. Other tags (manual tags, per-feed tags, parent folder tags not removed here) are left unchanged.
- Remove all tags — strip every tag from existing articles in the selected scope, including manual tags and tags from other rules.-
- This adds to the already existing "auto-tag by feed source" feature introduced in 2.4.0-beta.2. A full guide on all the tagging options are available: [docs/user/tags-primer.md](docs/user/tags-primer.md)

#### Shard Storage version 2 (v2)

- Added Shard Storage mode v2 to improve sync reliability across devices. This mode introduces a new user-state.json file alongside data.json, which stores per-article state — read/unread, favorited, saved, tags, and play progress. Feed shard files now contain only article content and the GUID used to link back to user-state.json. data.json now stores only plugin settings.
- This separation resolves race conditions that previously caused some sync tools (e.g. Remotely Save, WebDAV-based sync) to overwrite read/star/tag changes when a feed refresh on another device landed at the same time.
- v2 is opt-in: existing users on legacy or v1 storage can migrate via the new "Vault location (v2 — split user state)" option in the Storage settings tab. A confirmation prompt explains the change before migration runs.
- updated [docs/user/storage-vault-shards-guide.md](docs/user/storage-vault-shards-guide.md) to include v2 documentation and comparison of all 3 existing storage modes.

#### Sidebar feed fetch status

- Added a new red (!) icon adjacent to the unread badge which indicates a feed that failed to fetch. Hovering over the icon or right clicking the feed and selecting "View fetch error" will show the reason for the fetch failure. Long-press on mobile/tablet will also open the same right-click context menu.
- Added a new toggle setting in Sidebar tab to enable/disable the feed fetch status icon.

#### Autoproxies

- Added a new Auto setting to the Proxy dropdown in General Settings which cycles through the list of all proxies instead of only being allowed to choose one. This setting is enabled on by default.

#### Auto-refresh

- Added: configurable startup refresh delay (in seconds, default 5). This can be adjusted to reduce processing load upon startup.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed some feeds not properly rendering card previews (e.g. [World History Encyclopedia](https://www.worldhistory.org/rss/))
- Fixed laggy feeds (NPR)
- Fixed preview image not appearing in cards for feeds that don't have an image url provided.
- Fixed cards showing a blank gray card instead of just summary text, due to interpreting pixel tracker as the image.
- Fixed date inside card toolbar misalignment
- Fixed some feeds like TED Talks not properly showing summary text inside cards.
- Fixed mobile sidebar tags issue where tapping checked rows were unable to be unchecked.
- Fixed inline viewer not rendering reader toolbar
- Fixed some sidebar icons not properly rendering
- Fixed 'All Feeds' spinner not spinning on mobile/tablet when refreshing all feeds
- Fixed some broken favicons causing unnecessary internal code loops while trying to resolve

## 2.4.0-beta.2 - June 9, 2026

### New Features

#### Auto Tagging

- Added three ways to auto-tag articles: by feed source, by individual feed, and by folder. Tags can be combined, with folders cascading to descendant feeds.
- **Feed source**: Added to `Settings > Tags > Auto Tagging` - you can now enable multi-tag auto-tagging based on the feed source (for example, apply "RSS" to all RSS feeds, or "YouTube" to all YouTube feeds, or apply your own custom tags).
- **Individual feed**: Added a new "Custom auto-tags" dropdown in the Add/Edit feed window under the existing "Feed options" dropdown:
  - If feed-source auto-tags are enabled for that feed (via Settings), the individual feed tags are applied on top of the feed-source tags.
  - For example, if you have enabled feed-source auto-tags and applied "RSS" to all RSS feeds, and you also apply the individual feed tag "News" to that feed, all articles from that feed will be tagged with both "RSS" and "News".
  - If no feed-source auto-tags are configured, only the individual feed tags apply.

- Within the Edit feed window, the "Feed options" dropdown now shows a section for inherited feed-source auto-tags where applicable.
- **Folder auto-tags**: Right-click any folder in the sidebar and choose **Auto tag feeds in folder...** to assign tags that cascade to all feeds in that folder and its descendants. Tags are stored on the configured folder only; child folders inherit parent tags dynamically. Use **Existing articles** to sync folder auto-tags to stored articles (adds new rule tags and removes deselected rule tags while leaving other tags intact) or remove all tags in scope. See [docs/user/tags-primer.md](docs/user/tags-primer.md) for precedence and examples.

#### Podcast Player

- Added: Setting > Media > Podcast player setting where users can apply a default play speed that automatically applies when the player loads an episode.
- Added: "Autoplay" button in the playlist bar. Enabling it will autoplay episodes when the previous one finishes. Disabling it will only play the current episode and will prevent episodes from automatically playing.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed RSS feed profile favicon size overflow on Android devices where favicons in the sidebar were rendering at massive sizes instead of the intended 16x16px. Added explicit `max-width`, `max-height`, and touch-device CSS constraints for profile image icons (used by Mastodon feeds) to prevent uncontrolled scaling on mobile WebView browsers.
- Fixed a bug within 2.4.0-beta.1 which was writing unnecessary amounts of data to the JSON files causing performance degradation

### Changes

- Added two new settings tabs, 'Storage' and 'Sidebar'. These are refactors of already existing features contained elsewhere in the settings, but moved into their own dedicated tabs to improve the user experience.

## [2.4.0-beta.1] - June 5, 2026

### New Features

- Added Settings > General > Saved article open location option to control where saved articles open. [GH FR #131](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/131)
- Added ',' keybind to mark article read and advance to next article. [GH FR #183](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/138)
- Added Obsidian URI support for one-click feed subscription via `obsidian://rss-dashboard?action=add-feed&url=<encoded-feed-url>`, including parameter validation and unsupported-action notices. [GH FR #126](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/126)
- Added {{image}} to Article Saving template which includes URL to cover image if it exists [GH FR #128](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/128)

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
#### Saving articles to vault not saving article content

- [GH Issue #127](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/127) - appeared to be the same issue on the surface but turned out to be several:
- Certain feeds with malformed xml would corrupt the saved article. Added a new cleaner helper to sanitize the feed xml. [beehiiv.com example](https://rss.beehiiv.com/feeds/40ZQ7CSldT.xml)
- Certain feeds (i.e. Substack) would not save articles or images properly when saving article to vault due to Substack's content:encoded xml schema and our parsing helper not handling it properly.
- Fixed format discrepency between saving article via dashboard card and saving article via reader toolbar (different pathways interally but now both resolve the same way for the user's saved note)

#### Cross-platform sync reliability

- Added a new bootstrap pointer which saves metadata config locally so the app knows where to look upon restart.
- Changed default storage type for fresh plugin installs from Legacy JSON to Shard Storage - still retaining Legacy JSON as an option to ease transition for existing users.
- Resolves [GH Issue #142](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/142) and [GH Issue #140](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/140)
- Added a variable-length sync nonce (\_syncNonce + \_syncPad) to every saveData call, ensuring the file size changes on each write so Obsidian Sync reliably detects and uploads settings changes. When small changes were made that left data.json filesize unaffected, sync became unreliable. This hash appends a random string to the end of data.json between 1-2kb so data.json will always be different on each save.
- Added comprehensive step-by-step instructions for ensuring successful cross-platform sync of RSS Dashboard settings and data to [README.md ## Syncing Across Devices](README.md)

### Community Plugin Audit

- Remediation work on latest Community Plugin Audit (https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/rss-dashboard) - now standing at 72% compliance (up from 46% last version).
- **Dynamic `<script>` element creation**
  - Flagged as a red/critical risk due to 2.3.0's media progress saving feature (specifically Youtube iFrame embeds)
  - Rewrote how the progress is stored that adheres to Obsidian's best practices and Youtube SDK API
  - Added CI/CD ESLint rule to prevent dynamic `<script>` element creation in the future

- Completely eliminated all Node.js/Electron `fs` and `path` usages from the production plugin code
- Completely eliminated all superflous !important declarations; added comments to remaining declarations that pass audit and deemed necessary

## [2.3.0] - May 26, 2026

- Official Release. No additional changes added since 2.3.0-beta.3. See [docs/releases/2.3.0.md](docs/releases/2.3.0.md) for complete release notes.

## [2.3.0-beta.3] - May 19, 2026

### Features

#### New: Keyboard Shortcuts

- Implemented a new comprehensive keyboard shortcuts system to enhance navigation and productivity.
- To quickly access the keyboard shortcuts help file, press `?` (Shift + /) within the app. This will display a list of available shortcuts and their functions.

#### Playback Progress

- Added a new **Settings > Media > Remember Playback Progress** toggle to automatically save and restore podcast and video playback position across reader and plugin restarts.
- Additional information can be found within the ## Media Playback Progress Tracking section of [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) guide and assures users that all data is stored locally and no telemetry is collected .

#### Twitter/X/Nitter default folder

- Added Settings > Media > Twitter/X/Nitter default folder to specify a default folder for Twitter/X/Nitter feeds. This folder is auto-detected and suggested after user adds a Twitter/X/Nitter feed.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed Reader view article bodies disappearing for rich feed HTML on affected feeds such as Ars Technica and Substack.
- Fixed URLs ending in x mistakenly interpreting as x/nitter feeds [GH Issue #121 submitted by Wiloti](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/121)

## [2.3.0-beta.2] - May 15, 2026

### Features

- Added configurable metadata `data.json` location with dedicated migration controls and backup/import-export support. See: [docs/user/storage-vault-shards-guide.md](docs/user/storage-vault-shards-guide.md).
- Fixed Bloomberg-style video feed items being misclassified as restricted articles by improving media type detection (including image-first `media:content` handling and conservative video-route fallback), and added regression coverage for parser, media classification, reader surfaces, and save flow to prevent false paywall notices/banners.
- Added paywall/restricted-content detection so the Reader shows a banner when only excerpted content is available.
- Added automatic `Video` tagging for detected non-YouTube video items, plus a new **Settings > Media > Auto-tag videos** toggle (enabled by default). Existing users are migrated/backfilled safely.
- Added long-press support on folders in sidebar for mobile devices that performs the same right-click functionality as desktop. Resolves [GH Issue #113](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/113)
- Added new status section in edit feed modal to show location of feed ID, feed storage type (shard or legacy), and a copy button to quickly copy the local location.
- Added "URL" as a Rule target alongside title, summary, and content which allows filters based upon URL address (i.e. 'shorts' for YouTube Shorts) [GH PR #116 submitted by Caleb68864](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/pull/116)
- Added new Display setting to change from Relative timestamps (Today, 1 day ago, 1 week ago etc) to Absolute timestamps (e.g. May 15, 2026) [GH Issue #115 submitted by Thehone1](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/115)

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed bug where reverting from 'shard' storage back to 'legacy' caused all articles to become marked as past auto-deletion date.
- Fixed YouTube feed articles duplicating in shard storage when the same video was stored under different GUID forms (`yt:video:VIDEO_ID`, `watch?v=VIDEO_ID`, `/shorts/VIDEO_ID`). All three forms now normalize to a single canonical key so duplicates are prevented on refresh and existing duplicate pairs are auto-cleaned on load.

### Development

- **Compliance Audit: 45% → 100% Complete** ✅
  - Completed all items on the Obsidian Community Plugin audit scorecard.
  - Resolved all 37 "Disabling '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any'" occurrences by adding descriptive audit guardrail comments throughout the codebase.
  - Eliminated all unsafe `innerHTML` assignments in production rendering paths (replaced with `sanitizeAndAppendHtml`).
  - Migrated all global DOM API references to Obsidian's scoped `activeWindow` and `activeDocument` contexts (100+ occurrences) for popout window compatibility.
  - Replaced third-party `builtin-modules` dependency with native `module.builtinModules`.
  - Removed all deprecated Clipboard API fallbacks.
  - Final validation: ESLint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings), 130/130 test files passing (1180 tests).
  - See: [docs/development/plugin-scorecard.md](docs/development/plugin-scorecard.md)

- Relaxed eslint.config.mjs to now include testing files.
- Completed full burn-down of test-file ESLint backlog (2686 errors → 0 errors across 130 test files).
- Resolved all type-safety debt in test suite with boundary-cast pattern and strict interface definitions.
- Aligned `Notice` stub behavior with modern Obsidian API to resolve 21 unit test regressions.
- Added a new `Compliance Declarations (Audit Guardrails)` policy section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` with required pre-PR compliance checks.
- Added a new `Compliance Declarations (Audit Guardrails)` policy section to `CONTRIBUTING.md` with required pre-PR compliance checks.
- Added `docs/development/compliance-patterns.md` as the canonical implementation reference for audit-sensitive patterns (safe HTML rendering, boundary typing, popout-safe APIs, and DOM helper conventions).
- Added root `.instructions.md` and linked policy references in README/development docs/scorecard so AI-assisted and human contributions follow the same compliance guardrails.
- See: [docs/archive/investigations/2026/test-lint-backlog-tracker.md](docs/archive/investigations/2026/test-lint-backlog-tracker.md) for detailed test-file lint debt burn-down progress (54 passes, 2686 → 0 errors).

## [2.3.0-beta.1] - May 11, 2026

- New **Vault Shards storage mode**: Store article history in separate per-feed files instead of one large data.json file, with easy migration between modes.
- Enhanced storage controls: Manage storage mode, repair shards, and import/export data directly from General settings.
- Added a user-facing setup and FAQ guide for Vault Shards storage: [docs/user/storage-vault-shards-guide.md](docs/user/storage-vault-shards-guide.md).

## [2.2.0] - May 9, 2026

### Fixes (Patch)

- Dashboard article-state handling is now consistent across reader navigation, filter messaging, and per-feed retention updates: selected cards stay anchored below the sticky header after split/sidebar reader opens or layout changes; empty states now explain when articles are hidden by view filters, unread/read special views, age thresholds, or retention windows instead of falling back to a generic “No articles found”; and per-feed auto-delete duration changes now refresh and re-apply retention deterministically when toggled off/on or tightened, preventing old items from lingering or reappearing incorrectly.

### Features

- **"Add All" Button added to Discover page**
  - Added a new "Add All" button to the Discover page header. This button adds all feeds from the current page to the user's feed list.

- **Sort feeds by unread count**
  - Added a new option to the 'Sort' icon which organizes feeds by unread count.
  - Two options: High to Low / Low to High

- Added new "inline" reader view option to the general settings which opens the article in the same tab as the dashboard. (GH[#100](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/100))
- Added a new "external browser" reader view location option in General settings so article and media opens can bypass the in-app reader and launch in the system browser. (GH[#89](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/89))
- **Flexible Date Formatting for Templates** (GH[#102](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/102)):
  - Added support for custom date formats in article templates using Moment.js.
  - New variables: `{{dateShort}}` (renders as `YYYY-MM-DD`) and parameterized `{{date:FORMAT}}` (e.g., `{{date:YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm}}`).
  - Improved settings UI for Article Saving with a readable, row-by-row guide of all available template variables.
  - Full backward compatibility for `{{date}}`, `{{isoDate}}`, and `{{isoDateTime}}`.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Fixed badge color settings not syncing between color picker and hex input controls. Color picker now updates hex input immediately, and hex input now updates color picker after validation.
- Fixed a bug where the Obsidian tab title was not properly updating when switching between feeds.
- Per-feed Add/Edit Feed options now support a separate Auto-refresh "Off" override in addition to "Use global setting", and the explicit Off state is preserved when adding or importing feeds.
- Multi-feed refreshes now run through a bounded worker pool of 4 with a 15s per-feed timeout, keep runtime-only refresh state per URL, merge refreshed feeds back into settings during the run, and finish with one save plus a final dashboard refresh. Single-feed refresh stays on the lightweight direct path. (Old behavior: all feeds were being refreshed individually with no indication of progress or completion)
- Fixed Reader View Location So It Controls Article Opening into sidebars (GH[#100](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/100))
- Fixed Discover and Smallweb views incorrectly opening in the sidebar when Dashboard view location was set to a sidebar option; they now always open as a new tab in the main content area.
- Adding a feed as "Favorite" now also applies the "Favorite" tag and is removed when un-favorited.
- Fixed reader tag pills so tag colors now render correctly in Reader view instead of showing plain text with no colored background.
- Fixed tag color edits so Reader view now refreshes its open tag DOM immediately after popover/settings color changes, matching the existing dashboard tag refresh behavior without needing to reopen the article.
- Fixed podcast feeds that only expose channel-level artwork so shared feed artwork now appears correctly in podcast episodes and the player instead of being dropped during parsing/refresh.
- Fixed the Manage Feeds workflow so the modal now closes after the user initiates an OPML import instead of remaining open behind the import flow.
- Saved articles now persist across vault reloads (PR#106)
- Saved articles no longer truncate title names

### Improvements

- Optimized the feed refresh process to reduce unnecessary network requests.
- Added a per-feed "Exclude from refresh" option in Add/Edit Feed so selected feeds can be skipped by auto-refresh and bulk refresh actions while still allowing direct manual refresh.

## [2.2.0-beta.10] - April 2, 2026

### New Features

- **Sidebar Toolbar Divider**:
  - Decoupled the vertical divider from the discover icon - now a standalone, configurable element.
  - Added "Divider" to the icon visibility settings in Display tab.
  - The divider can now be enabled/disabled and reordered among other icons via drag-and-drop.
  - Default position is between Discover and Add Feed icons.

- **Smart Auto-Refresh on Vault Open**:
  - Feeds now automatically refresh when opening the vault if the configured refresh interval has elapsed since the last refresh.
  - **Before:** The refresh timer reset to zero each time Obsidian closed. Users had to manually refresh or wait for the interval to pass after reopening the vault.
  - **After:** The plugin now tracks the last refresh timestamp in settings. On vault open, it checks if enough time has passed and refreshes immediately if needed.
  - Manual refreshes (sidebar icon, right-click menu, header button) also update the timestamp.
  - Respects all existing refresh interval settings (5 min to 24 hours).

- **Auto Refresh: Off Option added**
  - Added a new "Off" option to the refresh interval dropdown in General > Global Feeds > Refresh Interval. Resolves GH Issue #92

- **Mark Page Read button added**
  - Appears at the bottom of the article list
  - Marks only the articles from the current page as read, but leaves remaining articles in the feed untouched.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- Android bug causing list and card views to regress after every open
- New feeds now reliably preserve the current global max item default when added, instead of inheriting a lower retained-item limit if parser output omits the per-feed override.
- Chevron clicks in sidebar now only toggle collapse - GH[#91](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/91)
- Auto-deleted items no longer reappearing as unread upon refresh (PR#87 submitted by emiraga)
- Fixed fresh-install startup auto-refresh from showing a “Refreshing 0 feeds” toast or failing before the feed parser initializes.

### Development

- **Testing Baseline for 2.2.0**:
  - Established the first durable repo-wide automated test baseline for the plugin.
  - The pre-testing reference point was `2.1.9`, which effectively shipped without a meaningful unit test suite beyond minimal Vitest scaffolding.
  - The repo now has **110 passing test files** and **820 passing tests**.
  - Global coverage baseline is now **51.72% statements**, **41.04% branches**, **46.12% functions**, and **52.73% lines**.
  - Added broad unit and integration-style coverage across core services, views, components, settings flows, modals, and plugin lifecycle behavior.
  - Added and expanded shared test infrastructure including Obsidian API stubs, JSDOM polyfills, and purpose-built harnesses for complex UI/service surfaces.
  - Coverage thresholds are now actively enforced in `vitest.config.mjs` at **lines 40 / branches 33 / functions 34** to prevent regression.
  - Added contributor-facing testing documentation and archived the phase-by-phase handoff artifacts used during the coverage push.

## [2.2.0-beta.9] - March 27, 2026

### New Features

- **Sidebar Horizontal Scrolling**:
  - Added support for horizontal scrolling in the sidebar header toolbar via the mouse scrollwheel.
  - Added click-and-drag horizontal scrolling for desktop and mobile touch devices.
  - Added "grabbing" cursor feedback and touch-drag optimization to prevent accidental icon clicks while scrolling.

- **XML support**: Import OPML window now allows XML filenames in addition to OPML filenames.
- **Feed View**:
  - Added a new "Feed" view mode for a social-media-style, single-column layout.
  - Features hero images, clamped text summaries, and integrated action toolbars.
  - Added a 3-button view toggle (List, Card, Feed) to the hamburger menu using the accessible `clickable-icon` pattern.
  - Added "Feed" view as a preference in General settings.
  - Improved Feed View image quality by prioritizing high-resolution images and implementing a "hero blur" background layout to handle varying aspect ratios gracefully.
  - Refactored the hamburger menu view toggle from individual buttons into a single consolidated dropdown menu with dynamic icons and enhanced theme compatibility for both dark and light modes.

- **Auto-backup**: Added auto-backup for data.json, OPML, and userdata on plugin unload. By default, OPML and userdata are backed up to the plugin's data directory. These can be changed in the import/export settings.

### Fixes

- Fixed the dedicated and inline Reader star controls being skipped by keyboard navigation. Both now work as toggle buttons with Enter and Space, announce their starred state to assistive technology, and show a visible focus indicator. [GH Issue #688](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard/issues/688)
- **Pagination**: Fixed a bug where the Dashboard would bypass pagination limits and display all articles when toggling view filters or switching to the "Unread" sidebar view.
- **Scroll Restoration**: Fixed a bug where the Dashboard would reset to the top when opening the Reader panel or resizing the window; implemented a focus-locking mechanism to keep the selected article in view.
- **Auto-delete bug**: Fixed a bug where imported feeds were not respecting the global default auto-delete duration.

### Development

- **Refactor article-list.ts**: Refactored article-list.ts monolith - extracted the filter menu and hamburger menu into separate components.

## [2.2.0-beta.8] - March 24, 2026

- **IMPORTANT**: Earlier limited releases intended for users experiencing specific issues were tagged as 2.3.0-alpha.1, 2.3.0-alpha.2, and 2.3.0-alpha.3. These were incorrectly versioned. They have been retroactively designated as 2.2.0-beta.5, 2.2.0-beta.6, and 2.2.0-beta.7 in our internal documentation. The original GitHub release tags have been left intact to avoid breaking any shared links. Development continues from 2.2.0-beta.8 forward.

### New Features

- **Customizable sidebar ordering (drag-and-drop)**:
  - Drag feeds to reorder within a folder (or move + insert between feeds).
  - Drag folders to reorder, and drag onto another folder to nest/un-nest (supports hierarchical organization).
  - Any manual reorder automatically switches the sidebar sort mode to a new **Custom** row to preserve your ordering.

- **Customizable sidebar toolbar icons**:
  - New setting: `Settings > Display > Icon visibility`.
  - Drag-and-drop or up/down buttons (mobile friendly).
  - Hide/show individual icons.
  - Hide/show entire toolbar.
  - New sidebar toolbar "settings" button (opens RSS-Dashboard settings).

- **Sidebar Tag Filtering**:
  - Revamped **Tags** section in the sidebar for easy management and improved filtering logic: **AND** (match all), **OR** (match any), and **NOT** (match none).
  - Inline **Add Tag** row with color picker integrated directly into the sidebar.

- **Podcast Player Sleep Timer**: Added a sleep timer to the podcast player to automatically stop playback after a specified duration (5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 minutes) (GitHub issue #75).
- **Podcast "Open in Browser" improvements**:
  - Fixed the toolbar button, which was previously non-functioning.
  - The button now attempts to resolve the podcast’s website URL from feed metadata, falling back to the podcast’s RSS feed URL if no website URL is found.
  - The dropdown now includes URLs found in the "Episode details" section of the podcast page, plus a link to the direct audio file.

- **Pocket Casts Support**: Added support for importing podcasts directly from Pocket Casts URLs (e.g., `https://pocketcasts.com/podcast/...`).
- **Robust Podcast Resolution**:
  - Implemented a multi-proxy fallback system (AllOrigins, CodeTabs) to handle network timeouts and CORS restrictions when resolving podcast feeds.
  - Added a "Semantic Discovery" fallback using the **iTunes Search API** to resolve feeds when Pocket Casts hides the RSS link from their web player source.
  - Added flexible metadata scraping to handle varied HTML attribute ordering in modern web layouts.

- **Proactive Proxy Validation**: The Add Feed and Edit Feed modals now check whether the CORS proxy is enabled before attempting to resolve Pocket Casts URLs, providing a clear warning and guidance if it’s disabled.
- **OPML Import Menu Overhaul**: The OPML import menu has been completely overhauled to improve reliability and user experience.
- **View Filter Setting Improvements**:
  - All applied view filters now persist across navigation (state is saved and restored on reopen/restart).
  - All applied view filters now explicitly state which ones are currently applied in the dashboard header.
  - Updated `Settings > Display > Startup filters` to mirror the dashboard filter UI, allowing multiple viewing filters to be applied at startup.

### Fixed

- **Reader tags menu**: Reader toolbar now uses the same tag management portal UI as dashboard cards (edit/delete/add tags, mobile sheet support).
- **Reader save button**: The save button icon in the reader now appropriately turns purple when saved and changes its tooltip to "Click to open saved article". Clicking it in this state will directly open the saved markdown file in your vault, mirroring the dashboard functionality. Also updated the "custom folder location" option to suggest folders based on your vault structure, with proper text validation that adheres to Obsidian’s folder naming conventions.
- **Reader Nitter rendering**: Improved X/Twitter (Nitter) feed items in Reader view with a compact author/handle/date title, a single formatted tweet body (no "Feed description" callout), and a compact stats icon row when present. Article titles no longer show the entire tweet and instead show the author, handle, and date.
- **Obsidian Properties UI compatibility**: Fixed a critical issue where enabling the plugin could cause vault-wide Properties "type mismatch" error indicators due to unscoped global CSS overrides.
- **Settings migration (Filters → Rules)**: The global `filters` setting has been renamed to `rules` to avoid confusion with viewing filters. The new implementation is backwards compatible with existing beta users’ settings via a one-time migration.
- **Article dedupe bug** Fixed duplicate articles for feeds (e.g. BBC) where item GUIDs can change between refreshes via numeric URL fragments (`#0`, `#1`, ...); existing stored duplicates are auto-deduped on load.
- **Pagination**: Fixed pagination controls not updating when switching between views. Added new 'All' option to page size dropdowns. Adjusting the pagination at the bottom of the page now sychronizes with the pagination controls in settings (General > Results shown per page).

### Development

- **Developer Documentation**: Added a new "Advanced Podcast Platform Resolution" section to the developer docs describing proxy rotation and semantic search patterns.
- **CSS Guardrail**: Added `npm run check:css-scope` (runs during `npm run build`) to prevent unscoped CSS rules from targeting Obsidian core selectors (e.g., `.clickable-icon`, `.suggestion-container`, `.hidden`).
- **Settings Architecture Refactor**:
  - Refactored the monolithic settings tab into a modular architecture for maintainability and performance.
  - Split settings rendering into 9 dedicated tab renderer modules.
  - Centralized shared settings modal classes.
  - Isolated pure tab-name helpers to enable zero-dependency unit testing.
  - Used TDD-driven logic for color normalization, icon reordering, and preset detection.
  - Added many new unit tests covering settings-related logic.
  - Reduced the main settings tab orchestrator to ~119 lines.

- **Feed manager refactor**:
  - Reorganized the feed manager modal code to be more modular and maintainable (kept backwards compatibility for now; planned for deprecation in the next major release).
  - UI: standardized “supported formats” badges using Lucide icons.
  - Folder handling: improved folder-path collection and removed duplicate folder traversal across folder pickers and the sidebar.
  - Fix: corrected nested folder deletion behavior.
  - Tests: expanded unit coverage across feed manager behavior, sidebar “Add Feed” opening, folder-path utilities, preview loading, and nested folder removal.

- **ReaderView Refactor**: Extracted the reader format settings portal into a helper, added ReaderView cleanup on close, and added unit coverage.

## [2.3.0-alpha.3 / 2.2.0-beta.7] - March 18, 2026

### New Features

- **Sidebar Feed Filtering** (github issue #74): Added a new setting "Hide empty feeds/no unread articles" to automatically hide feeds with zero articles or only read articles from the sidebar.
- **Standardized Icon Rendering**:
  - Refactored all interactive icons to use the Obsidian-recommended `clickable-icon` pattern.
  - Replaced standard HTML `<button>` elements with accessible `div` structures for better cross-platform (Android) compatibility.
  - Added full keyboard support (Enter/Space) to all interactive icons.
  - Centralized icon sizing via the `--icon-size` CSS variable.

- **Reader Settings Refactor**:
  - Touch sliders not ideal for mobile devices due to base Obsidian touch behavior, replaced with dropdowns to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.
    - Replaced "Words per row" slider with a percentage-based "Paragraph width" dropdown (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
    - Replaced "Font size" slider with a discrete dropdown (80% to 200%).
    - Replaced "Line height" slider with a discrete dropdown (100% to 200%).
  - Added 2px horizontal padding for 100% paragraph width to improve readability.

### Fixed

- **YouTube Feed Discovery** (github issue #77): Fixed an issue where adding certain YouTube channels would return the wrong RSS feed by prioritizing metadata tags (`rel="canonical"` and `itemprop="channelId"`) over generic page content.
- **Android/iOS Rendering**: Fixed multiple instances where icons failed to render or appeared broken on mobile devices.
- **iOS Feed Content**:
  - Fixed an issue where Substack and Psychology Today articles appeared empty on iPhone by implementing robust XML namespace extraction using `getElementsByTagNameNS` instead of `querySelector`.
  - Fixed full article content fetching (via Readability) failing on iOS for sites with strict WAFs (like Psychology Today) by introducing a tiered fetch mechanism with a configurable CORS Proxy fallback. You can now enable and configure a CORS proxy in the settings (see reference `docs/bugs/ios-full-article-fetch-failure.md`).
- **Reader Rendering** (discord issue): Improved article display logic to ensure content is always rendered as the primary body, even if it matches the feed description.
- **ESLint/Build Integrity**:
  - Cleaned up multiple ESLint & TypeScript compilation errors in `ReaderView`.
  - Implemented strictly-typed Obsidian app and plugin interfaces for safer API access.
  - Standardized `HighlightService` and `robustFetch` usage to match modern patterns.
- **Feed and Folder Validation** (github issue #67):
  - Added strict validation for forbidden characters (`[ ] # ^ | / \ : * " < > ?`) and leading dots in feed titles and folder names.
  - Integrated validation into Add Feed, Edit Feed, and Folder Rename modals to prevent data corruption and filesystem issues.
  - Improved `sanitizeName` logic to provide better defaults during automated imports (e.g., OPML).

### Development

- **Testing**: Added unit tests for namespaced XML extraction and reader logic in `test_files/unit/ios-namespace-fix.test.ts`.
- **Build Logging**: Added explicit confirmation messages to `esbuild.config.mjs` to verify successful JS and CSS bundling.
- **Removed**
  - **YouTube Short Detection**: removed feature introduced in 2.3.0-alpha.1 due to inconsistent tagging. Added a comprehensive [bug report](docs/archive/investigations/2026/youtube-shorts-tagging-failure.md) for future reference.
  - **YouTube Short Detection**: removed feature introduced in 2.3.0-alpha.1 due to inconsistent tagging. Added a comprehensive [bug report](docs/archive/investigations/2026/youtube-shorts-tagging-failure.md) for future reference.

- **Global Feed Settings**: Added a global feed settings in General tab to set default values for new feeds

### Fixed

- Fixed some feeds losing older history (often collapsing to ~25 items) after refresh; refresh now preserves previously cached items outside the server “latest N” window and applies per-feed retention deterministically.
- Per-feed options now always show when adding a new feed (collapsed by default, follows default global feed settings)
- Podcast player now keeps play/pause button state in sync during autoplay
- Sorting/shuffling the podcast playlist no longer interrupts playback
- Switching episodes via the playlist no longer auto-plays unexpectedly
- Article title in reader now hidden on mobile view
- Reader settings sheet now notch-safe on iPhone, with improved touch layout, slider sizing, and a bottom “Done” CTA
- Card/List view: Article titles no longer reserve an empty second line for short titles; titles now clamp to 2 lines with truncation.
